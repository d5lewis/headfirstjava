          Java works by placing a translator between the bytecode and the machine.  In theory, 
          this allows us to write the code once, and compile it to a single bytecode source.  
          The virtual machine then takes care of the heaving lifting to run that code on all 
          machines.

          Java is open and "free."  Except that it isn't.  Oracle is suing Google over not properly
          paying for licenses when writing the Android OS.  When asked in court whether or not 
          Java is free, Larry Ellison CEO of Oracle answered "I don't know."

          In theory, only one class is supposed to go inside each ".java" file.  However I don't think
          this is a rule in practice, and might be more of a recommendation.

          Every Java application must have a main method, and this is what the JVM looks for to enter 
          the application.  Every Java application can only have one main method.  This is per 
          application, not per class.
