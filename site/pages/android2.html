    <h2 class="headline">Android App Manifest</h2>
    <p>
      Every app project must have an AndroidManifest.xml file (with precisely that name) at 
      the root of the project source set. The manifest file describes essential information 
      about your app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play.
    </p>
    <ul class="sublists">
      <h2>The manifest file must:</h2>
      <li>
        Declare the applications package name which conventionally matches the code namespace
      </li>
      <li>
        Declare the components of the app, which include all activities, services, broadcast receivers, 
        and content providers. Each component must define basic properties such as the name 
        of its Java class. It can also declare capabilities such as which device configurations 
        it can handle, and intent filters that describe how the component can be started.
      </li>
      <li>
        Declare the permissions that the app needs in order to access protected parts of the system or 
        other apps. It also declares any permissions that other apps must have if they want to access content from this app.
      </li>
      <li>
        Declare the hardware and software features the app requires which affects which devices can 
        install the app from Google Play.  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you're using Android Studio to build your app, the manifest file is created for you, and most of the essential 
      manifest elements are added as you build your app
    </p>
