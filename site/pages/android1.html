      Android apps are built as a combination of components that can be invoked individually.  
    </p>
    <ul class="sublists">
      <li>Activities are apps with a UI</li>
      <li>
        Broadcast receivers are components in your Android application that 
        listen in on broadcast messages(or events) from different outlets: 
        From other applications. From the system itself. From your application.
      </li>
      <li>Services allow the app to perform background tasks without a UI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK 
        tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK, an Android 
        package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the 
        contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install 
        the app.

      Non-intuitive fact: Android OS is a multi-user Linux system and each app is considered a 
      different user -- in their own sandboxed environment.   
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android system implements the principle of least privilege. That is, each app, by default, 
      has access only to the components that it requires to do its work and no more. This creates 
      a very secure environment in which an app cannot access parts of the system for which it is not 
      given permission. However, there are ways for an app to share data with other apps and for an app 
      to access system services
    </p>
    <ul class="sublists">
      <li>
        It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they 
        are able to access each other's files.
      </li>
      <li>
        An app can request permission to access device data such as the device's location, camera, and Bluetooth 
        connection. The user has to explicitly grant these permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Content providers manage a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite 
        database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access
      </li>
    </ul>
