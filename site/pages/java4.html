    <h2 class="headline">Primitive Types</h2>
    <p>
      There are primitive types like long, int short, byte, float and double.  Then there are 
      types that are references to objects.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The names must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.  Note: it cannot start 
      with a number.  Cannot be a key word.  
    </p>    
    <h2 class="headline">Objects</h2>
    <p>
      There are no such things as object variables, only references to objects... Which makes it 
      sound like everything is a pointer.  
    </p>

      The names must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.  Note: it cannot start 
      with a number.  Cannot be a key word.
    </p> 
    <p>
      If the keyword 'final' is used, the object cannot be changed to references something else.  
      Without it, any object can be assigned as a different version of that same type of object.  
    </p>
    <p>
      After use, if an object is ever intentionally assigned null, it is eligible for garbage collection. 
    </p>

      Can I do pointer arithmetic like C?  Nope.  Java is not C.  But maybe the JVM does do this
      behind the scenes, but we cannot be sure.
