    <h2 class="headline">What is this Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) thing?</h2>
    <p>
      Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) enables your objects to have their dependencies provided 
      to them automatically, instead of creating them or receiving them as parameters. CDI also manages 
      the lifecycle of those dependencies for you.
    </p>    
    <ul class="sublists">
      <h2>The fundamental services provided by CDI are:</h2>
      <li>
        Contexts: This service enables you to bind the lifecycle and interactions of stateful components
        to well-defined but extensible lifecycle contexts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dependency injection: This service enables you to inject components into an application in a typesafe
        way and to choose at deployment time which implementation of a particular interface to inject.
      </li>
      <h2>But CDI also provides many other services:</h2>
      <li>
        Integration with the Expression Language (EL), which allows any component to be used directly within 
        a JavaServer Faces page or a JavaServer Pages page
      </li>
      <li>
        The ability to decorate injected components
      </li> 
      <li>
        The ability to associate interceptors with components using typesafe interceptor bindings
      </li>
      <li> 
        An event-notification mode
      </li>
      <li>
        A web conversation scope in addition to the three standard scopes (request, session, and application) 
        defined by the Java Servlet specification
      </li>
      <li>
        A complete Service Provider Interface (SPI) that allows third-party frameworks to integrate cleanly 
        in the Java EE 7(+?) environment
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="headline"> What does all of this mean? </h2>

    <p>
      By utilizing Java CDI, we are no long in control of when methods get called and how long
      they are saved in memory.  Utilizing the CDI framework provides instances of objects
      needed by other objects (called injection).  This is done at run-time.  
    </p>
    <p class="innerp">
      The benefits of CDI are looser coupling, easier unit testing, and most extensible code.
