    <h2 class="headline">Is Android a JVM?</h2>
    <p>
      It isn't.  
      <br><br>
      For the Java Platform, Java Bytecode is executed by the Java Virtual Machine.  The compiler
      converts source code written in the Java Programming Language, or any other JVM language, into
      bytecode for the JVM.
      <br><br>
      For Android, the compiler converts source code written in the Java Programming Language into
      bytecode for the Dalvik Virtual Machine.
      <br><br>
      Android does not have a JVM.  The JVM and DVM work in entirely different ways.  
      One is a stack-based (the JVM) system, the other is a register based (the DVM) system.
      <br><br>
      On newer Androids, the new Android Runtime (ART) replaces the Dalvik Virtual Machine. 
      This technically isn't a virtual machine anymore as it pre-compiles and builds the
      code into native ELF executables upon install. This is done improve load and run
      times by using native code.
    </p>
    <h2 class="headline">What is a Dalvik Virtual Machine?</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike Java Virtual Machines, which are stack machines, the Dalvik VM uses a register-based 
      architecture that requires fewer, typically more complex, virtual machine instructions. Dalvik 
      programs are written in Java using the Android application programming interface (API), compiled 
      to Java bytecode, and converted to Dalvik instructions as necessary.
      <br><br>
      A tool called dx is used to convert Java .class files into the .dex format. Multiple classes are 
      included in a single .dex file. Duplicate strings and other constants used in multiple class files 
      are included only once in the .dex output to conserve space. Java bytecode is also converted into an 
      alternative instruction set used by the Dalvik VM. An uncompressed .dex file is typically a few 
      percent smaller in size than a compressed Java archive (JAR) derived from the same .class files
    </p>
    <h2 class="headline">What is the Android Runtime?</h2>
    <p>
      The successor of Dalvik is Android Runtime (ART), which uses the same bytecode and .dex files
      (but not .odex files), with the succession aiming at performance improvements transparent to 
      the end users. The new runtime environment was included for the first time in Android 4.4 "KitKat" 
      as a technology preview, and replaced Dalvik entirely in later versions; Android 5.0 "Lollipop" 
      is the first version in which ART is the only included runtime.
