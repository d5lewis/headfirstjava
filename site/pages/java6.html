      A non-primitive variable holds a reference to an object, not the object itself. 
      Objects live on heap.  If a local variable is a reference to an object, only
      the variable (the reference) goes on the stack, the object itself still lives 
      on the heap.  
    </p>
    <p>
      All local variables live on the stack in the frame corresponding to the method
      where the variables are declared.  
    </p>
    <h2 class="headline">While we're at it, some notes on Object creation</h2>
    <p>
      Usually, the compiler will create a no-arg constructor for you if you don't 
      implement one yourself.  However, if we implement a constructor with arguments,
      this is not the case, and the code will not compile.  So if you create a 
      constructor of any kind, you need to also create the default, no-arg constructor
      if it would ever be used.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Furthermore, if you have more than one constructor in a class, the constructors 
      must have different argument lists.  Even a change as small as re-ordering the 
      arguments is enough to be a different constructor, but it seems to me like this 
      would be poor practice.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      All the constructors in an objects inheritance tree must run when you make a new 
      object.  This means every superclass has a constructor that is called all the 
      way up the call chain, before the sub-classes constructor is called. If variables
      need to be passed to the super constructor, super must be called on the first line
      of the sub-class's constructor.   
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Even abstract classes have constructors that are called when a sub-class is 
      instantiated. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      If your constructor is marked private, you can never make an instance of that 
      class. In the standard library, Math is built this way.   
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Note: Use the keyword static to get as close as Javaly possible to global methods/
      variables.  These methods can be run without creating an instance of a class.  
    </p>
    <h2 class="headline"> And finally, some notes about Object deletion.</h2>
    <h3 class="headline"> There are three ways an object is marked for Garbage Collection:</h3>
    <ul class="sublists">
      <li>
        When a reference to an object goes out of scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a reference to an object is assigned to another object.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a reference to an object is set to null. 
      </li>
    </ul>
