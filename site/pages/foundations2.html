    <h2 class="headline">What is Static Binding?</h2>
    <p>
      Static Binding: The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as
      static or early binding. Binding of all the static, private and final methods is done at 
      compile-time.
    </p>
    <p class="innerp">
      Point blank, static binding is just better performance wise. But that doesn't 
      always ensure expected behavior.  What will the output of the below snippet be?
    </p>

    <p>
      Static binding is better for performance.  The compiler knows that all such methods cannot be 
      overridden and will always be accessed by an object of the local class.
    </p>
    <p class="innerp">
      We have created one object of subclass and one object of superclass both with the type superclass.
      Since the print method of superclass is static, the compiler knows that it will not be overridden 
      in subclasses and the superclass print method is called with no ambiguity.
    </p>
    <h2 class="headline">What is Dynamic Binding?</h2>
    <p>
      In Dynamic binding compiler doesnâ€™t decide the method to be called. Overriding is a perfect 
      example of dynamic binding. When overridding both parent and child classes have same method. 
    </p>
    <img src="/media/dynamicbinding.png" alt="Dynamic Binding Example">
    <p>
      The methods are not static in this code.  During compilation, the compiler has no idea as to which 
      print has to be called since the compiler goes only by referencing variable not by type.  Therefore the binding 
      would be delayed to runtime with the JVM making the decision.  This will be a bit slower of an implementation, 
      but it allows for more flexibility in the programming.  
    </p>
    <p class="innerp">
      Lesson learned: If we are sure they method will not be overridden, make it static or private to avoid binding 
      at runtime (UX vs. DX paradigm)
